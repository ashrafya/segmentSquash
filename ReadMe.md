# **Squash Match Video Segmentation - Project Requirements**

## **1. Project Overview**
Develop a computer vision system to process squash match videos, segmenting players, court boundaries, court markings, and the ball.

## **2. Functional Requirements**
### **2.1 Video Input Processing**
- Accept video input from a camera or pre-recorded footage.
- Support common formats (MP4, AVI, MOV) with different resolutions and frame rates.
- Handle varying lighting conditions and camera angles.

### **2.2 Player Segmentation and Tracking**
- Detect and segment both players separately.
- Track players across frames to maintain identity.
- Differentiate players using color, shape, or learned features.
- Handle occlusions when players overlap.

### **2.3 Court and Markings Segmentation**
- Identify court boundaries and key markings:
  - Service box
  - Tin
  - Out lines
  - Other relevant court markings
- Ensure robustness against occlusions (e.g., players blocking the view).
- Adapt to different court designs and lighting variations.

### **2.4 Ball Detection and Tracking**
- Detect the squash ball even during high-speed motion.
- Track the ballâ€™s trajectory across frames.
- Handle motion blur and sudden changes in direction.

### **2.5 Output Visualization**
- Overlay segmented players and court boundaries on the original video.
- Provide different visualization modes:
  - Bounding boxes
  - Masks
  - Edge highlights
- Annotate detected features (e.g., ball position, speed).

## **3. Technical Requirements**
### **3.1 Computer Vision Techniques**
- Use deep learning models for detection:
  - YOLO or Faster R-CNN for player and ball detection.
  - Mask R-CNN or U-Net for segmentation.
- Classical computer vision techniques for court markings:
  - Edge detection (Canny, Sobel)
  - Hough Transform for line detection
- Optical flow or Kalman filters for ball tracking.

### **3.2 Data and Training**
- Use labeled squash match datasets (or create and annotate a custom dataset).
- Train models on GPU-enabled hardware for efficiency.
- Implement real-time processing optimizations (e.g., model pruning, tensor quantization).

### **3.3 Software and Frameworks**
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, NumPy
- **Video Processing:** OpenCV, FFmpeg
- **Deployment:** Local machine or cloud infrastructure

## **4. Performance Requirements**
- Achieve real-time or near real-time processing (>30 FPS preferred).
- Maintain high accuracy (>90%) in player segmentation.
- Ensure robust ball tracking despite high-speed movement.
- Handle variations in court appearance and lighting without significant performance degradation.

## **5. Challenges and Considerations**
- **Motion Blur:** Fast ball movement can cause blurring, making detection difficult.
- **Player Overlap:** Players may occlude each other, requiring robust tracking methods.
- **Lighting Variability:** Different lighting conditions can affect segmentation accuracy.
- **Camera Angles:** Adapt to different viewing perspectives and camera setups.
